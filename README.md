# ai-on-z-containers

## Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide container build files for AI software that can be utilized in s390x 
environments.

These container files (i.e., dockerfiles or containerfiles) are provided as examples that can be used directly 
or built upon. They build open-source based (not proprietary) images. 

## Usage
These build files commonly rely on base images from the [IBM Z and LinuxONE Container Image Registry (ICR) ](https://ibm.github.io/ibm-z-oss-hub/main/main.html). 
This will require free basic authentication. Details can be found at the ICR link above.

Note that numerous pre-built s390x images are available in ICR.

Additional dockerfiles can be found on the [LinuxONE github organization](https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/dockerfile-examples).
